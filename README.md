# Cloud-Computing-Project-2

The project is to build the virtual cluster of 8 nodes on Amazon EC2 using i3.large instance types and generate a dataset of 1 TB in size to evaluate the performance of sorting the 1 TB data using Hadoop and Spark. Also, one node of i3.4xlarge instance type is setup to generate the 1 TB dataset and sort the data using Hadoop and Spark. The results of both pseudo mode and distributed systems are compared to draw the benchmark.
